## Purpose

The Funnel is StarSeek's Great Filter — a convergence point where the dominant life on a planet faces existential choices. It is not a boss fight, a puzzle to solve, or a challenge to optimize. It is a **consequence** — the accumulated result of every attunement choice, every harmony encouraged, every antagonism ignored.

The Funnel is where StarSeek makes its philosophical argument: that the way you grow determines whether you survive.

## Triggering the Funnel

The Funnel activates when the dominant life tree (or coalition) crosses the **Complexity Threshold**, defined by:

- **Technology Index** — Ability to manipulate planetary-scale systems (atmosphere, geology, oceans)
- **Population Density** — Resource consumption approaches planetary carrying capacity
- **Awareness Index** — Degree of self-awareness about their own impact (influenced by Wisdom Relics)

The exact threshold varies by planet — small planets funnel sooner, large planets have more runway.

## Funnel Phases

### Phase 1: The Approach

Duration: Medium (several game cycles)

The dominant civilization begins to feel planetary limits. Narrative intensifies.

Signs visible to the player:
- Resource extraction rates approach regeneration limits (visual indicators on planet surface)
- Atmospheric or oceanic composition begins shifting
- Life tree interaction tensions heighten — even previously harmonized trees feel pressure
- The scrolling narrative shifts to a more urgent register

Player influence: This is the last window for meaningful attunement intervention. Deepening attunement here can tip the balance.

### Phase 2: The Crisis

Duration: Short and intense

One or more crisis events strike, determined by the dominant life tree's path to dominance:

| Dominance Path | Crisis Type |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Harmony Dominance** | Resource coordination test — can the coalition share under extreme pressure? |
| **Competitive Dominance** | Rivals seize the moment of stress to challenge dominance; fragile alliances crack |
| **Aggressive Dominance** | Weapons developed for suppression are turned inward; civil fracture or planetary damage |

Crisis events are not random — they are logical consequences of what came before.

### Phase 3: The Outcome

The crisis resolves into one of three states:

#### Outcome A: Collapse
- The dominant civilization destroys itself or renders the planet uninhabitable
- Other life trees may survive at reduced complexity
- The planet becomes a **Ruin World** — visually scarred, with unique ruin relics
- Future visitors (the player returning, or other players in multiplayer) can explore the ruins
- The scrolling narrative becomes an **epitaph** — a final paragraph that memorializes what was lost
- *The player does not lose — but the planet does. The player carries the memory forward.*

#### Outcome B: Scarred Survival
- Life survives but at great cost — population reduced, ecosystems damaged, trust broken
- Development continues but at reduced capacity and speed
- Some solar system expansion is possible, but limited
- The narrative tone becomes **resilient but haunted**
- Certain advanced relics become inaccessible (the knowledge to use them was lost in the crisis)
- *A second chance, but a harder road.*

#### Outcome C: Transcendence
- The harmonized civilization passes through the Funnel intact
- A moment of collective breakthrough — the life trees see themselves and their world clearly
- Utopic potential unlocked: cooperation deepens, technology serves wisdom
- Full solar system expansion begins
- The narrative becomes **luminous** — prose shifts to a tone of arrival and possibility
- An **Attunement Relic** manifests automatically — the planet itself becomes a resonance point in the galaxy
- *This is what attunement was building toward.*

## What Influences the Outcome

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dominance path (harmony/competitive/aggressive) | Heavy | The single strongest predictor |
| Player attunement depth at stages 4–5 | Significant | Seeds initial conditions |
| Player attunement during Life Emergence | Moderate | Late-stage harmony nudges help |
| Wisdom Relics discovered | Moderate | Each one raises the Awareness Index |
| Tech Relics without matching Wisdom | Negative | Power without understanding is destabilizing |
| Number of surviving life trees | Moderate | Biodiversity = resilience |
| Exotic life tree presence | Slight bonus | Their unusual perspectives add flexibility |

## Funnel Visuals

The Funnel should be the most visually dramatic moment in a planet's lifecycle:

- **Approach:** Subtle darkening of the planet's palette; weather patterns intensify
- **Crisis:** Visible surface changes — fires, storms, ocean shifts, structural collapse or construction
- **Collapse:** The planet's surface scars visibly; color drains; orbital debris may appear
- **Scarred Survival:** Partial recovery; the planet looks patchy — green alongside gray
- **Transcendence:** A brief, beautiful visual bloom — light radiates from the surface, the planet's color palette deepens and clarifies

---

## The Narrative During the Funnel

The scrolling narrative accelerates during the Funnel — paragraphs arrive more frequently, and the prose becomes more direct:

**Approach examples:**
- *"The northern forests are thinning faster than they can regrow. The mammalian cities demand more each season. The mycelium network, stretched thin, sends warnings that no one above ground can hear."*

**Crisis examples:**
- *"The first weapon that can crack the mantle has been built. The question is not whether it works. The question is what kind of civilization builds such a thing and what they intend to become."*

**Collapse examples:**
- *"Silence. The oceans are still. The cities are dark. Beneath the ash, the mycelium endures — but it has forgotten what it was connecting."*

**Transcendence examples:**
- *"They looked up together — all of them, every lineage, every branch of every tree that had learned to see. And the galaxy, which had been waiting, looked back."*

---

## Post-Funnel Transition

After the Funnel resolves:

- **Collapse** → The planet enters a dormant state. The player may continue to other planets in the system or Seek & Hop. The ruin world persists and can be revisited.
- **Scarred Survival** → Transition to Stage 8 (Expand) with reduced capabilities. Some solar system resources are accessible.
- **Transcendence** → Full transition to Stage 8 (Expand). All solar system development options available. The planet becomes a beacon.

## Design Notes

- **The Funnel should feel inevitable, not unfair.** The player should be able to look back and understand why a collapse happened.
- **Transcendence should feel earned, not guaranteed.** Even harmony-dominant planets can fail if the player neglected attunement.
- **Collapse is not game over.** It's a chapter ending. The galaxy is vast. What the player learned carries forward.
- **The Funnel mirrors real evolutionary and civilizational dynamics** — but stylized and compressed into a playable arc. It should provoke thought, not despair.
