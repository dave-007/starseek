# Stage 5: Attune

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)
Parent: [Core Loop Overview](../core-loop-overview.md)

## Summary

The galaxy responds to the player's development choices. Attunement is a two-way conversation: the player's elemental expression is received by the ambient intelligence, which reveals and conceals in response. This stage determines whether the planet is ready for life.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- Attunement score: accumulated from development choices, not a single action
- Galaxy response: visual and mechanical — new resources revealed, paths opened or closed
- Elemental deepening: the player's affinity profile becomes more nuanced
- Planetary readiness: attunement depth determines if/when Life Emergence triggers
- Concealment: aggressive or dissonant attunement may hide certain possibilities

## Connection to Life Emergence

Attunement is the bridge to Stage 6:
- Attunement depth determines Life Emergence timing
- Elemental signature determines which life trees are viable
- Harmony of attunement influences initial harmony/antagonism balance

## Open Questions

- Is attunement a discrete event or a continuous process?
- How does the player perceive the galaxy "responding"?
- Can attunement be deepened retroactively during Life Emergence?
