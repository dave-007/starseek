# Stage 2: Survey

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)

## Summary

Zoom into the solar system. Discover planets, moons, asteroids, and other objects orbiting the star. The system's composition reflects its elemental nature and procedural seed.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- Solar system layout: star at center, objects in orbits
- Object types: planets (rocky, gas, ice), moons, asteroid belts, anomalies
- Elemental signatures: each object radiates elemental affinity clues
- Hidden objects: some objects are only visible at higher attunement levels
- System-level relics: orbital structures, Lagrange point artifacts

## Open Questions

- How many objects per system? Range and variation?
- Can the player interact at system level, or must they descend to interact?
- How are asteroid belts represented visually?
