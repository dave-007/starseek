# Stage 9: Seek & Hop

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)
Parent: [Core Loop Overview](../core-loop-overview.md)
Prerequisite: [Stage 8 — Expand](./08-expand.md)

## Summary

The culmination of a solar system's arc. The player has accumulated enough power, resources, and attunement to leap to a nearby solar system on the galactic sphere. The hop carries forward the player's accumulated way of being — every choice echoes into the next system.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- **Hop threshold:** Energy + attunement + resources sufficient for interstellar travel
- **Destination selection:** Choose from nearby systems on the galactic sphere; attunement may reveal hidden paths
- **Carry-forward:** What transfers — elemental affinities, attunement depth, discovered wisdom, relic effects
- **System memory:** The system left behind persists — it can be revisited, and in multiplayer, others may find it
- **The transition:** The hop itself should be a meaningful visual/narrative moment, not just a loading screen

## What Carries Forward

| Element | Carries? | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Elemental affinity profile | Yes | Core identity persists and deepens |
| Attunement depth | Partially | Base level carries; planet-specific attunement is local |
| Wisdom gained | Yes | Understanding is permanent |
| Tech knowledge | Partially | Some tech is system-specific; universal principles carry |
| Relic effects | Some | Attunement and Wisdom relics persist; Tech relics may be system-bound |
| Life tree experience | Indirectly | The player's gardening instincts improve; the life trees themselves stay |

## Open Questions

- Can the player maintain connection to previous systems, or is the hop a clean break?
- Does the galaxy sphere change appearance based on visited systems?
- How does the hop interact with the ambient intelligence — does the galaxy guide destination choice?
- What's the pacing — should the player visit 5 systems? 50? Unlimited?

## Transition

→ Stage 1: [Arrive](./01-arrive.md) — The loop begins anew, shaped by everything that came before.
