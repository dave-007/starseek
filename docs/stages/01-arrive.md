# Stage 1: Arrive

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)
Parent: [Core Loop Overview](../core-loop-overview.md)

## Summary

The player reaches a new solar system — a point on the galactic sphere. This is the moment of first contact with an unknown system. The galaxy's ambient intelligence may offer subtle hints about what lies ahead based on the player's accumulated attunement.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- Arrival animation: smooth zoom from galactic sphere to solar system scale
- First impressions: star type, number of visible objects, elemental "scent"
- Ambient intelligence whispers: subtle cues shaped by player history
- If multiplayer: signs of other players' presence or past visits

## Open Questions

- Does the player choose where to arrive, or is it guided by attunement?
- How much information is revealed before zooming in?
- Should previously visited systems look different from the galactic view?
