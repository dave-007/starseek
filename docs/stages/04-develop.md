# Stage 4: Develop

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)
Parent: [Core Loop Overview](../core-loop-overview.md)

---

## Summary

Harvest resources, discover hidden resources, and express an elemental way of being on the planet's surface. This is the core "play" phase at planetary level — the actions taken here seed everything that follows, including which life trees may emerge in Stage 6.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- Resource types: tied to elemental affinities (Air, Earth, Fire, Water)
- Extraction methods: different approaches yield different results and leave different marks
- Hidden resource discovery: attunement reveals what exploration alone cannot
- Elemental expression: player choices accumulate into an elemental "signature" on this planet
- Development footprint: actions visibly change the planet's surface

## Connection to Life Emergence

The development patterns laid down here directly influence Stage 6:
- Which life trees are seeded
- Starting conditions for harmony vs. antagonism
- Where surface relics become accessible

## Open Questions

- What does "development" look like in abstract visual terms?
- How does the player make elemental choices — direct selection or emergent from actions?
- How long should development take before attunement becomes available?
