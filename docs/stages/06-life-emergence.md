# Stage 6: Life Emergence

Version: 0.1
Parent: [Core Loop Overview](../core-loop-overview.md)

---

## Purpose

Life Emergence is StarSeek's mid-game transformation. A planet shifts from being a place the player develops into a place that develops itself — with the player's attunement as its evolutionary soil. This stage generates the emotional core of each solar system visit: you don't just extract from a world, you witness (and influence) what it becomes.

## When Life Emergence Triggers

Life Emergence begins when a planet meets **all** of the following:

- Attunement score crosses a planetary threshold (varies by planet size and elemental mix)
- At least two elemental affinities are expressed on the planet
- The player has spent meaningful development time (not just a fly-by attunement)

Planets that are never attuned (or barely touched) remain inert — resource nodes only.

## Life Trees — Deep Design

### What Is a Life Tree?

A life tree is not a single species. It is an entire **evolutionary lineage** — a branching tree of organisms that share a fundamental biological paradigm. "Mammalian" doesn't mean one mammal species; it means an entire kingdom of warm-blooded, social, adaptive creatures that branch and diversify over planetary time.

Each life tree has:

- **Growth Rate** — How quickly it expands and diversifies
- **Resilience** — How well it survives environmental shocks
- **Complexity Ceiling** — How far it can develop before hitting natural limits
- **Harmony Affinity** — Its tendency to cooperate with other trees
- **Antagonism Trigger** — What conditions cause it to become aggressive

### The Eight Core Life Trees

#### 1. Mycelium (The Networkers)
- **Paradigm:** Distributed intelligence, underground connectivity, resource sharing
- **Elemental Affinity:** Earth / Water
- **Growth:** Slow to start, exponential once established
- **Resilience:** Extremely high — survives most planetary catastrophes underground
- **Complexity Ceiling:** High — can develop planet-wide distributed consciousness
- **Harmony:** Natural harmonizer; bonds easily with Flora, Crystalline
- **Antagonism:** Triggered by wholesale destruction of soil ecosystems
- **Unique Mechanic:** Mycelium networks can detect buried relics; the larger the network, the deeper the sensing range

#### 2. Flora (The Builders)
- **Paradigm:** Photosynthetic growth, atmospheric engineering, patient expansion
- **Elemental Affinity:** Water / Air
- **Growth:** Steady, reliable
- **Resilience:** Moderate — vulnerable to fire and rapid climate shifts
- **Complexity Ceiling:** Moderate — develops sophisticated biochemistry but limited tool use
- **Harmony:** Strong with Mycelium (symbiotic), moderate with Avian
- **Antagonism:** Triggered by rapid deforestation or atmospheric poisoning
- **Unique Mechanic:** Flora reshapes the planet's atmosphere over time, potentially unlocking conditions for other life trees

#### 3. Mammalian (The Adapters)
- **Paradigm:** Social intelligence, tool use, emotional bonding, generalist strategy
- **Elemental Affinity:** Fire / Earth
- **Growth:** Moderate, with bursts during favorable conditions
- **Resilience:** Moderate — adaptable but fragile in extreme conditions
- **Complexity Ceiling:** Very high — can develop technology, language, civilization
- **Harmony:** Variable; capable of deep cooperation or intense competition
- **Antagonism:** Triggered by resource scarcity, territorial pressure, or fear
- **Unique Mechanic:** Mammalian life trees are the most likely to discover and use Tech Relics, but also the most likely to misuse them

#### 4. Reptilian (The Endurers)
- **Paradigm:** Cold efficiency, territorial dominance, deep-time survival
- **Elemental Affinity:** Fire / Earth
- **Growth:** Slow but steady
- **Resilience:** Very high — low metabolic needs, tolerant of harsh conditions
- **Complexity Ceiling:** High — can develop sophisticated social hierarchies and technology
- **Harmony:** Low natural harmony; prefers dominance or isolation
- **Antagonism:** Triggered by encroachment on territory; default to competition
- **Unique Mechanic:** Reptilian civilizations build the most durable structures — their ruins persist longest after collapse

#### 5. Crystalline (The Resonators)
- **Paradigm:** Mineral-based consciousness, resonance communication, geological timescales
- **Elemental Affinity:** Earth / Air
- **Growth:** Extremely slow by biological standards; measured in geological epochs
- **Resilience:** Extraordinary — essentially indestructible short of planetary destruction
- **Complexity Ceiling:** Unknown — operates on timescales that make measurement difficult
- **Harmony:** Passive harmony with everything; rarely initiates interaction
- **Antagonism:** Almost never antagonistic; only reacts to direct physical destruction
- **Unique Mechanic:** Crystalline life resonates with Attunement Relics; if present on a planet, attunement effects are amplified

#### 6. Fungal-Insectoid (The Swarmers)
- **Paradigm:** Hive intelligence, rapid reproduction, biomechanical adaptation
- **Elemental Affinity:** Water / Fire
- **Growth:** Explosive — fastest initial growth of any tree
- **Resilience:** Moderate — individual units are fragile, but the swarm regenerates
- **Complexity Ceiling:** High — can develop sophisticated distributed computation
- **Harmony:** Moderate; cooperates when the swarm benefits, ignores otherwise
- **Antagonism:** Triggered by competition for biomass; can overwhelm other trees rapidly
- **Unique Mechanic:** Fungal-Insectoid swarms can rapidly process organic relics, extracting benefits faster than any other tree — but sometimes destroying the relic in the process

#### 7. Cetacean-Aquatic (The Singers)
- **Paradigm:** Sonic intelligence, oceanic civilization, deep empathy, fluid structures
- **Elemental Affinity:** Water / Air
- **Growth:** Moderate; limited by ocean availability
- **Resilience:** High in aquatic environments; zero on land
- **Complexity Ceiling:** Very high — can develop rich culture, science, and philosophy
- **Harmony:** Very high natural harmony; rarely antagonistic
- **Antagonism:** Triggered only by ocean destruction or sonic pollution
- **Unique Mechanic:** Cetacean civilizations generate Wisdom naturally over time; the longer they exist, the more Wisdom Relics "crystallize" in their ocean depths

#### 8. Avian-Aerial (The Wanderers)
- **Paradigm:** Migration intelligence, atmospheric mastery, song-based culture
- **Elemental Affinity:** Air / Fire
- **Growth:** Moderate; population limited by nesting sites and atmospheric conditions
- **Resilience:** Moderate — mobile enough to survive local disasters, vulnerable to global ones
- **Complexity Ceiling:** High — develops navigation, communication, and aerial architecture
- **Harmony:** Moderate; generally peaceful but fiercely competitive during nesting
- **Antagonism:** Triggered by habitat loss and atmospheric degradation
- **Unique Mechanic:** Avian life trees are the first to detect incoming solar-system-level events (asteroid impacts, solar flares), giving early warning to harmonized partners

### Exotic Life Trees

On planets with unusual elemental combinations, rare life trees may emerge:

- **Plasma Entities** (Fire-dominant worlds) — Energy beings; fast, brilliant, short-lived
- **Silicon Dreamers** (Crystal-heavy moons) — Digital-organic hybrids; think in patterns
- **Tide Shapers** (Water-dominant with strong gravitational fields) — Gravity-sensitive organisms that build with tidal forces
- **Void Listeners** (Attuned planets near galactic edge) — Life that feeds on background radiation and cosmic signals

## Harmonization & Antagonism Mechanics

### The Interaction Matrix

Every pair of life trees has a **base interaction tendency** that can shift based on planetary conditions and player attunement. The matrix is not fixed — it's a starting point that evolves.

### How Interaction Works

Each game tick during Life Emergence:

1. **Proximity check** — Which life trees share territory?
2. **Resource overlap** — Are they competing for the same resources?
3. **Harmony/Antagonism calculation** — Base tendency + resource pressure + player attunement influence
4. **Outcome** — Cooperation bonus, neutral, competitive penalty, or active conflict

### Dominance Paths

Life trees grow toward dominance through one of three paths:

- **Harmony Dominance** — A tree (or coalition) grows dominant by cooperating broadly. Other trees thrive alongside it. The planet's total complexity rises. *This is the path most likely to survive the Funnel.*
- **Competitive Dominance** — A tree outcompetes others through efficiency and adaptation. Other trees decline but aren't destroyed. The planet is productive but brittle. *Moderate Funnel survival chance.*
- **Aggressive Dominance** — A tree suppresses or destroys competitors. Short-term power, long-term instability. The planet is powerful but volatile. *Low Funnel survival chance.*

## Relics — Deep Design

### Relic Types

| Type | Grants | Found By | Risk |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| **Tech Relic** | Technological breakthrough (energy, materials, propulsion, computation) | Exploration, excavation, Mammalian affinity | Can be weaponized by aggressive civilizations |
| **Wisdom Relic** | Understanding leap (diplomacy, ecology, self-knowledge, cosmic awareness) | Attunement depth, Cetacean affinity, Crystalline resonance | None — but can be ignored by aggressive civilizations |
| **Attunement Relic** | Deeper connection to the galactic ambient intelligence | Harmonic convergence of multiple life trees, deep player attunement | Reveals the planet to other players/AIs in multiplayer |
| **Hybrid Relic** | Unpredictable combination of tech and wisdom | Extremely rare; found only through unusual life tree combinations | Powerful but may have unexpected consequences |

### Relic Placement

- **Surface relics:** Visible with sufficient exploration; found in unusual geological formations, ancient impact craters, tidal zones
- **Subsurface relics:** Detected by Mycelium networks or deep excavation
- **Orbital relics:** Found in asteroid belts, moon surfaces, or stable Lagrange points
- **Resonance relics:** Not physical objects; they "manifest" when attunement conditions are met — a harmonic convergence between life trees, or a moment of deep player attunement

### Relic Discovery Narrative

When a relic is found, the scrolling narrative shifts to mark the moment — a paragraph of discovery prose that hints at the relic's origin and significance. Relics should feel *found*, not *earned* — they are gifts from the galaxy's deeper nature, not loot drops.

---

## The Scrolling Narrative — Deep Design

### What It Is

A persistent, drifting text element that tells the planet's story in real time. One paragraph appears at a time, scrolling slowly along a randomly chosen screen edge.

### Narrative Triggers

| Event | Narrative Tone |
|-------|---------------|
| Life tree first emerges | Wonder, possibility |
| Two trees begin harmonizing | Warmth, connection |
| Competition intensifies | Tension, uncertainty |
| A relic is discovered | Awe, mystery |
| Antagonism erupts | Urgency, sorrow |
| A tree goes extinct | Elegy, loss |
| Harmony dominance established | Hope, celebration |
| Approaching the Funnel | Gravity, anticipation |

### Technical Behavior

- **Position:** Random screen edge selected at Life Emergence start; may shift edges between paragraphs
- **Speed:** Slow drift — readable without rushing, but not stationary
- **Persistence:** Each paragraph fades after ~30 seconds or when the next one arrives
- **Style:** Variable font weight and opacity based on narrative intensity
- **Player interaction:** Clicking/tapping a narrative paragraph pauses it and expands it; a small log icon opens the full planetary narrative history

### Prose Style Guide

The narrative voice is that of a **cosmic naturalist** — observant, poetic, never didactic. It watches and reports. It does not instruct the player.

Examples:
- *"Beneath the iron plains, something listens. Threadlike and patient, the first mycelium network stretches between two buried stones, tasting minerals it has no name for."*
- *"The singers have found the deep trench. Their songs echo for kilometers now, carrying patterns that even they don't fully understand — but the crystalline formations along the trench walls have begun to hum in response."*
- *"Fire. The mammalian settlements on the northern ridge burn. Not from the sky this time — from each other. The smoke rises and the flora on the windward slopes begin to close their pores."*

## Player Influence During Life Emergence

The player does not directly control life trees. Instead, they influence conditions:

- **Elemental attunement choices** (stages 4–5) determine which trees are seeded and their starting conditions
- **Resource development patterns** create or destroy habitats
- **Relic placement** (for relics the player has found) can accelerate specific trees
- **Attunement deepening** during Life Emergence subtly shifts the harmony/antagonism balance toward harmony

The player is a gardener, not a general.

---

## Transition to Stage 7: The Funnel

Life Emergence ends when a dominant life tree (or harmonized coalition) crosses the **Complexity Threshold** — a point where civilization-scale choices become possible and unavoidable. The narrative scroll announces the approach:

*"The [dominant tree] have reached the edge of what this world can teach them gently. What comes next will be remembered — or there will be no one left to remember."*
