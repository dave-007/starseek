# Stage 3: Descend

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)
Parent: [Core Loop Overview](../core-loop-overview.md)

## Summary

Zoom from solar system level to a specific planet, moon, or object. The surface comes into view — abstract but evocative. This is where hands-on interaction begins.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- Smooth zoom transition from orbit to surface
- Surface generation: procedural terrain shaped by elemental mix
- Initial resource visibility: basic resources obvious, deeper ones hidden
- Atmosphere/environment indicators: color palette, particle effects
- Landing zone selection: where on the surface does the player begin?

## Open Questions

- Is the entire surface explorable, or does the player work from a focal point?
- How abstract vs. detailed should surfaces be?
- Can the player ascend back to system level freely?
