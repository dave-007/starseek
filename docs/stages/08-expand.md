# Stage 8: Expand

Version: 0.1 (Stub — to be detailed)

## Summary

Post-Funnel civilizations that survive begin developing the broader solar system. This stage scales the player's influence from planetary to solar-system-wide, building the energy and resources needed for the ultimate Seek & Hop to the next star.

## Key Mechanics (To Detail)

- **Solar system presence:** Establish colonies/outposts on moons, asteroids, neighboring planets
- **System-scale resources:** Materials and energies inaccessible at planetary level
- **Solar system relics:** Ancient orbital structures, deep-space artifacts, Lagrange point discoveries
- **Interplanetary life:** Life trees may spread to other viable bodies in the system
- **Energy accumulation:** Building toward the Seek & Hop threshold

## Funnel Outcome Effects

| Funnel Outcome | Expansion Capability |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Transcendence** | Full access — all system resources, all relics, fastest accumulation |
| **Scarred Survival** | Partial access — some resources locked, slower accumulation, certain relics inaccessible |
| **Collapse** | No expansion — planet is a ruin; player must Seek & Hop from diminished position |

## Connection to Life Emergence

Life trees that survived the Funnel continue to develop during Expansion:
- Harmonized coalitions spread through the solar system cooperatively
- Individual dominant trees expand according to their paradigm (Mycelium networks between moons, Avian colonies on atmospheric bodies, etc.)
- The scrolling narrative continues, now at solar system scale

## Open Questions

- How long should Expansion take relative to Life Emergence?
- Can the player trigger Life Emergence on other planets in the same system?
- What does "utopic status" look like mechanically?
- How does Expansion interact with multiplayer — can other players visit your system?
