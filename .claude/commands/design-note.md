# /design-note

Add or update a design note in `docs/game-design.md`.

1. Read `docs/game-design.md` to understand the current structure.
2. Find the most relevant section for the user's note, or create a new subsection.
3. Add the note cleanly — don't duplicate existing content, don't remove anything.
4. If the note resolves a question marked with `?` or `TODO`, update that marker.
5. Write the updated file.
6. Tell the user which section was updated.
