# /arch

Show the current StarSeek technical architecture.

Read `docs/architecture.md` and present a clear, human-readable summary covering:
- The state machine and how state transitions work
- Each source file and its responsibility
- The phenomenon system (how to add new toggleable animations)
- Key Three.js patterns in use
- Known constraints and things to avoid

Keep the output concise — use headers and bullets, not prose paragraphs.
